			<h2>Year at Lewis: Senior</h2>
			<h2>Lewis majors & minor: Computer Science and Data Science with Minor in Mathematics</h2>
			<h2>Reasons for pursuing this degree: </h2>
        <p> I took a few CS classes in high school and they intrigued me and challenged me unlike any other classes I took, and then I found a huge interest in Data Science.</p>

			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p> My name is Tony Kochev, I am a son to Bulgarian immigrants, brother to a UW-Madison student, and coach to the Joliet West Cross Country team. 
			All my life I have lived in Joliet, IL and love the place, attending Joliet West High School and continuing my education in the area. Dispite this 
			my Bulgarian heritage has drawn me to all parts of Europe many times and has sparked my desire to travel. Sports have always been a huge part of 
			my life, i’ve playing soccer since I could walk and now compete in Ironmen and other running events from 5ks to 50 miles, and maybe even a 100k soon. 
			This led me to coaching cross country and track at my old high school. At Lewis I double major in Computer Science and Data Science with a minor in Mathematics.
			I also work in the Office of Technology as a student worker in the networking department. </p>
